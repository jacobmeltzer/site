Hi there! I'm Jacob. This fall, I'll be moving to San Francisco and starting as a software engineer at [Stripe](https://stripe.com).

I studied Computer Science at [Brown University](https://brown.edu) in Providence, Rhode Island. During the summer I interned at [Stripe](https://stripe.com), [Shopify](https://shopify.com), and did some freelance web design for multiple homeowners associations and businesses. During the school year, I served as a teaching assistant and as a member of the planning team for our school's hackathon, Hack@Brown.

Outside of school and work, I'm interested in tennis and running, I love eating, I want to learn about flipping items on the internet, and I'm always down for new adventures. 

Feel free to get in touch!
